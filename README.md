# HTML, CSS, & Javascript code-challenge :
 - ### Day 1 : To Do App
   - Creating a simple to do list.
   - What I learned:
     - Basic DOM manipulation
       - createElement
       - removeChild
       - appendChild
     - using Forms
       - when form is submitted, page will re-render. To stop this from happening, call `event.preventDefault()` in event handler.
